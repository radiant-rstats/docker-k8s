# Kubernetes vs Plain Docker Comparison

Decision guide for the student container system.

## Quick Recommendation

**Use Plain Docker** (the new system in this directory) because:
- âœ… Same user experience as K8s
- âœ… 90% less complexity
- âœ… Easier to debug and maintain
- âœ… Lower overhead (2-4GB RAM savings)
- âœ… Faster container startup
- âœ… Simpler updates and changes

Kubernetes is overkill for this use case unless you need features like auto-failover, multi-node clusters, or sophisticated scheduling.

## Detailed Comparison

| Aspect | Kubernetes (microk8s) | Plain Docker |
|--------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Complexity** | High - K8s concepts, kubectl, yaml | Low - standard Docker commands |
| **Resource Overhead** | 2-4GB RAM for K8s itself | ~100MB |
| **Installation** | microk8s install + addons | Docker only |
| **Maintenance** | K8s upgrades, API changes | Docker upgrades |
| **Container Startup** | 10-15 seconds | 5-10 seconds |
| **Debugging** | Multi-layer (K8s + Docker) | Single layer (Docker) |
| **Port Management** | NodePort (30000-32767) | Any port (we use 20000+) |
| **Logs** | kubectl logs | docker logs |
| **Updates** | Update Deployment, rollout | Pull image, recreate container |
| **Learning Curve** | Steep | Gentle |
| **Documentation** | K8s docs (complex) | Docker docs (standard) |
| **Student Experience** | SSH via ProxyCommand | SSH via ProxyCommand (same) |
| **Multi-node Support** | Yes (can scale across servers) | No (single server) |
| **Auto-failover** | Yes | No |
| **Resource Limits** | Yes (requests/limits) | Yes (--memory, --cpus) |
| **Scheduling** | Advanced (affinity, etc.) | Manual |

## Feature-by-Feature Analysis

### âœ… What Both Systems Do Equally Well

- Per-user container isolation
- Home directory mounting
- SSH access via ProxyCommand
- Resource limits (CPU, memory)
- Port assignment
- VS Code Remote-SSH compatibility
- Container lifecycle management
- Auto-start on connection

### ðŸŽ¯ What Kubernetes Does Better

1. **Multi-node clusters:** Can distribute containers across multiple servers
   - *Do you need this?* **No** - single server (sc2) with 1TB RAM is sufficient

2. **Auto-failover:** If a container crashes, K8s automatically restarts it
   - *Do you need this?* **No** - student containers are stateless (data in home dir)

3. **Advanced scheduling:** Can place containers based on node resources, affinity rules
   - *Do you need this?* **No** - all containers run on same server

4. **Rolling updates:** Can update containers with zero downtime
   - *Do you need this?* **No** - containers can restart (students just reconnect)

5. **Service discovery:** Automatic DNS for containers
   - *Do you need this?* **No** - students connect directly via SSH port

6. **Load balancing:** Built-in load balancer for services
   - *Do you need this?* **No** - one container per student

### ðŸŽ¯ What Plain Docker Does Better

1. **Simplicity:** Standard Docker commands everyone knows
   - `docker ps`, `docker logs`, `docker restart` vs `kubectl get pods`, `kubectl logs`, etc.

2. **Lower overhead:** No K8s control plane consuming resources
   - **Savings:** 2-4GB RAM, 1-2 CPU cores

3. **Faster startup:** No K8s scheduling overhead
   - **Time saved:** 3-5 seconds per container

4. **Easier debugging:** Single layer to troubleshoot
   - Docker logs + container exec vs K8s pods + deployments + services + networking

5. **Direct control:** No abstraction layer
   - Direct Docker API access

6. **Simpler updates:** Pull image, done
   - vs K8s: update deployment yaml, apply, manage rollout

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Student Can't Connect

**Kubernetes:**
```bash
# 1. Check pod status
microk8s kubectl get pods -l user=aaa111

# 2. Check pod details
microk8s kubectl describe pod rsm-msba-aaa111-xxxxx

# 3. Check service
microk8s kubectl get svc rsm-msba-ssh-aaa111

# 4. Check logs
microk8s kubectl logs rsm-msba-aaa111-xxxxx

# 5. Check events
microk8s kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp

# 6. Possibly check K8s networking, CNI, etc.
```

**Docker:**
```bash
# 1. Check container
docker ps -f name=rsm-msba-aaa111

# 2. Check logs
docker logs rsm-msba-aaa111

# 3. Restart if needed
docker restart rsm-msba-aaa111
```

**Winner:** Docker (3 commands vs 6+ commands)

---

### Scenario 2: Update the Container Image

**Kubernetes:**
```bash
# 1. Pull new image
docker pull vnijs/rsm-msba-k8s:latest

# 2. Update deployment yaml or trigger rollout
microk8s kubectl set image deployment/rsm-msba-aaa111 rsm-msba-container=vnijs/rsm-msba-k8s:latest

# 3. Wait for rollout
microk8s kubectl rollout status deployment/rsm-msba-aaa111

# 4. Repeat for each student (or use labels)
# OR: delete all pods to force recreation
```

**Docker:**
```bash
# 1. Pull new image
docker pull vnijs/rsm-msba-k8s:latest

# 2. Students get new image automatically on next connect
# (start-container.sh detects image change and recreates container)
```

**Winner:** Docker (automatic vs manual for each student)

---

### Scenario 3: Check System Resource Usage

**Kubernetes:**
```bash
# 1. Check pod resources
microk8s kubectl top pods

# 2. Check node resources
microk8s kubectl top nodes

# 3. Check Docker (K8s uses Docker underneath)
docker stats

# Note: kubectl top requires metrics-server addon
```

**Docker:**
```bash
# 1. Check container resources
docker stats
```

**Winner:** Docker (simpler)

---

### Scenario 4: Add New Student

**Kubernetes:**
```bash
# 1. Student runs script
/opt/k8s/bin/start-pod.sh

# 2. Script creates deployment and service
microk8s kubectl apply -f /tmp/student-config.yaml

# 3. Wait for pod to be ready
# (handled by script)
```

**Docker:**
```bash
# 1. Student runs script
/opt/docker-containers/start-container.sh

# 2. Script creates container
docker run ...

# 3. Wait for SSH ready
# (handled by script)
```

**Winner:** Tie (both automated, similar workflow)

---

### Scenario 5: Server Crashes (Disaster Recovery)

**Kubernetes:**
```bash
# After reboot:
# 1. Start microk8s
microk8s start

# 2. Wait for K8s to be ready (30-60s)
microk8s status --wait-ready

# 3. Pods should auto-restart (if configured)
# 4. Or students reconnect to trigger recreation
```

**Docker:**
```bash
# After reboot:
# 1. Docker starts automatically (systemd)
# 2. Containers with --restart policy auto-start
# 3. Or students reconnect to trigger start
```

**Winner:** Tie (both recover automatically)

---

### Scenario 6: Scale to Multiple Servers

**Kubernetes:**
```bash
# Add new server to cluster
microk8s add-node
# Run join command on new server

# K8s automatically schedules pods across nodes
```

**Docker:**
```bash
# Need to:
# 1. Set up Docker Swarm or custom orchestration
# 2. Or manually distribute students across servers
# 3. Or use shared NFS for home directories + load balancer
```

**Winner:** Kubernetes (designed for this)

**However:** You have one server with 1TB RAM. Not needed.

---
